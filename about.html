  <p>
    My name is Taylor, and I’m currently learning web development and coding.
    I enjoy learning how technology works behind the scenes. In my free time,
    I like watching NFL football and NBA basketball, working out, and gaming.
    My goal is to keep improving my skills and eventually use web development
    in my career. This portfolio shows my progress and the projects I’m working
    on as I grow as a developer.
