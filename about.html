<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Taylor, and I am currently studying web development with the hope to build
professional and user-friendly websites. I enjoy learning how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
work together to create interactive web pages. My goal is to continue improving my skills
and eventually work on real-world projects.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy watching NFL football, NBA basketball, staying active through
fitness, and playing video games. These interests help keep me motivated and balanced
while I continue learning new technical skills.</p>
